# SharedMedia-Nolly

This addon is a shared media addon for World of Warcraft. It adds additional
sounds to the shared media pool that I've created for different events in the
game. This addon will be recieving frequent updates as I add more sounds to the
pool. If you have any suggestions for sounds to add, please let me know via
Discord (nollychi) or Twitter (@nollychii)!
